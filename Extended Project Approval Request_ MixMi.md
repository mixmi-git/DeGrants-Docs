**Total Grant Amount: $1,000**

**Project Description:**

MixMi's MVP, live on testnet at [mixmi.app](http://mixmi.app), is a browser-based DJ mixer with a blockchain twist. Users remix 8-bar loops and mint the results as NFTs, automatically aggregating rights from all contributors. Each loop used earns 1 STX at minting, while the system preserves splits, linked to creator wallets, and handles both recording and composition rights. Remixers get derivative licenses, blending creativity with fair compensation on Stacks. Beyond mixing, creators get profile pages that double as customizable websites for content distribution. By addressing business aspects of music creation, MixMi aims to build a sustainable platform where artistic vibes thrive alongside clear, fair arrangements.

There has been a demand for music on Stacks, and MixMi aims to meet this need. Alpha creators include vocalists, remixers, producers, and indie labels worldwide. Our long-term vision is to enable infinite remixing with rights attached, prioritizing people and culture. MixMi plans to continue developing music tools and seek larger funding to expand its capabilities. By creating a licensing working group and a standardized SIP, we aim to build a foundation for an extensive music licensing framework on Stacks.

**MVP Features:**

* DJ Mixer Interface: **A user-friendly browser-based DJ mixer for remixing 8-bar loops.**  
* NFT Minting: **Users can mint remixed tracks as NFTs.**  
* Automatic Rights Aggregation: **The system automatically aggregates and preserves rights from all contributors.**  
* Earnings: **Each loop used earns 1 STX at minting.**  
* Derivative Licenses: **Remixers receive derivative licenses for fair compensation.**  
* Profile Pages: **Creators get extensive profile pages that double as customizable websites for content distribution.**

**Impact**

We believe our mixer, with its rights and splits system, can be a jumping-off point for music collaboration and exploration on Bitcoin, and the first of its kind. Licensing is critical for music collaboration and new revenue streams, such as sync licensing music for film and video. Initiate the creation of a basic licensing framework, grounded in established legal practices. Lay the foundation for a Stacks-wide music licensing standard, crucial for enabling new revenue streams like sync licensing for film and video.

Actively involve the Stacks community to ensure our standards evolve to meet emerging technological and industry needs, fostering innovation beyond our initial concepts. By simplifying rights management and enabling fair compensation, we aim to attract more artists to the Stacks ecosystem, democratizing music creation and distribution in the Web3 space.

Blockchain offers a transparent, decentralized way to manage rights and royalties, ensuring artists are fairly compensated.

The rise of NFTs has introduced new revenue streams for artists, allowing them to monetize their work in innovative ways. NFTs provide a way to attach ownership and rights directly to digital assets, simplifying the process of buying, selling, and licensing music. Additionally, the demand for music in digital and visual media is growing, making sync licensing a critical area for development.

By leveraging these trends, MixMi aims to position itself at the forefront of the music industry's evolution, providing tools and frameworks that simplify rights management and foster collaboration.

**Legal Considerations**

Navigating the legal landscape is crucial for MixMi's success. Our framework will adhere to established legal standards to ensure compliance and protect all parties involved. Key legal considerations include:

* **Copyright and Intellectual Property:** Ensuring all remixed content respects original copyrights and properly credits all contributors. This involves tracking the original works and derivatives accurately.  
* **Licensing Agreements:** Developing clear and enforceable licensing agreements that define the terms of use for remixed content. These agreements must cover aspects like duration, territory, and the scope of usage.  
* **Royalties and Revenue Distribution:** Implementing transparent and automated systems for distributing royalties and revenue to rights holders. This includes defining how earnings from minting and sales are split among original creators and remixers.  
* **Data Privacy and Security:** Protecting user data and ensuring secure transactions within the platform. Compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR is essential.  
* **Jurisdictional Compliance:** Ensuring that the legal framework complies with the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions where the platform operates. This includes understanding the nuances of copyright law across countries.
